# Test Prep Study

## CB Sections 5.1 - 5.6

### 5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects

- Programs can be beneficial, but can also be used in harmful ways (street cameras can take pictures of people without their permission if they are hacked)
- Computing can have negative health effects (dopamine spikes, addiction, etc.)
- Flowcharts & Unified Modeling Language - different styles of coding, used to model procedures (what they will do). 

Actions:
1. Social Media can be used for communication and entertainment, but can also harm people emotionally
2. Online databases for banks can be very helpful for organizing data, but if they are accessed illegally hackers can access people's money and bank accounts.
3. Satellites can be used by companies like Google Maps to create accurate maps or  take pictures of places, but if they are hacked, they can expose secret military locations/instalations and infringe on people's privacy.

- I understand the concern about dopamine and things like video games, but I think that if you have self control it won't be a problem. I have never missed school or had my grades suffer because of games or social media.

### 5.2 - Digital Divide

- Not all people have access to the internet or computer programs because of where they live or how much money they have
- Can also depend on government (people in China can't access same things as people in US)
- Coders and programers should have digital divide in mind when creating or working on computer software

Actions: 
1. Empowering yourself in the digital world means to give yourself the correct resources and materials to thrive and reach your full potential.
2. People who are empowered can help others by teaching them or helping them get the resources they need.
3. I think that some red tape is increasing the digital divide, because it slows down or stops the rate at which people with less technological opportunites can reach the same level of understanding or knowledge that others can.

### 5.3 - Computing Bias

- Sometimes programs can exclude specific groups or people, purposefully or not
- Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:
   - Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (male vs female, rich vs poor)
   - Technical: technical contrainsts and considerations (better or worse computers, more/less resources to work with)
   - Emergent: Arises in context of use (e.g. Android turns out to have better app options than iOS)

Actions:
1. What caused the program to react this way?
2. I think that this was unintended, as there is almost no chance such a racist feature would be added into a program worked on multiple programs developed for HP, one of the most well known tech companies in the world.
3. If I was the one making or working on this program, I would have sure to test it with multiple faces (age, gender, race, etc.) It's honestly surprising that such a well known company as HP could have slipped up in something as simple (but impactful) as this.

### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing
