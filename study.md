### CB Sections 5.1 - 5.6

#### 5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects

- Programs can be beneficial, but can also be used in harmful ways (street cameras can take pictures of people without their permission if they are hacked)
- Computing can have negative health effects (dopamine spikes, addiction, etc.)
- Flowcharts & Unified Modeling Language - different styles of coding, used to model procedures (what they will do). 

**Actions:**
1. Social Media can be used for communication and entertainment, but can also harm people emotionally
2. Online databases for banks can be very helpful for organizing data, but if they are accessed illegally hackers can access people's money and bank accounts.
3. Satellites can be used by companies like Google Maps to create accurate maps or  take pictures of places, but if they are hacked, they can expose secret military locations/instalations and infringe on people's privacy.

- I understand the concern about dopamine and things like video games, but I think that if you have self control it won't be a problem. I have never missed school or had my grades suffer because of games or social media.

#### 5.2 - Digital Divide

- Not all people have access to the internet or computer programs because of where they live or how much money they have
- Can also depend on government (people in China can't access same things as people in US)
- Coders and programers should have digital divide in mind when creating or working on computer software
