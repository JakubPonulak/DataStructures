## CB Sections 5.1 - 5.6

### 5.6 - Safe Computing

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Information about you on the internet, some of it good, other info can be harmful
  - Good: Name, email, accomplishments, credit report, etc.
  - Bad: passwords, SSN, tax records, Address, etc.
- Use things like 2-Factor authentication to stay safe, beware malware, phishing, etc
- Encryption (symmetric and asymmetric) help keep information and data access off the web

Actions:
1. PII that we include in our CSP projects is our names, contact info, what school we go to, our previous projects/assignments.
2. I think that I am not very exposed, that there is little to none bad PII about we accessible to the public (or through nefarious methods)
3. A good password is long, random, and uses alphanumerics + special symbols. A bad password is short and easy to guess.
4. Symmetric encryption only uses 1 (private) key, and is faster but less secure. Asymmetric encryption is a more modern method that uses 2 keys (public and private), which takes longer but is more secure.
5. When we deploy, we encode private information about the machine and user that made the deployment, such as IP address.
6. When I was younger, I used to believe ads or emails that said something like "Click here for a million Gems!" (in some game). Though I never gave away any private information, I did believe that these were serious/legitimate methods. Other phishing examples would be "winning" a sweepstake or a lottery, but to access it you need to provide your bank account info.

### 5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns

- Companies and teams use different licenses when publishing their work
- Linux: free for use to the public, Open Source
- Qualcomm: makes money on patents, not possible with same license as Linux
- Always cite sources (code, images, etc.)
- Businesses need to make money, but won't last without open source software

Actions:
1. I think that if I wanted to make a profit off of my projects, I would use something like the Open Source MIT license, which would allow me to sell closed source versions of it. If I wanted my projects to be available to everyone and free to use, I would use Creative Commons 0 or GPL.
2. The license I have chosen for my personal GitHub pages is GNU GPLv3, because I want people to be able to use the information I provide without having to pay for it. Since this material is educational, I want people to easily access it, which is easiest to do with GPL. This license also allows people to modify or add on to my project, and also make those projects open source and free to use by other people. The license our team selected for our group project, managed by Mr. Mortensen, is 


### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing

- Obtain shared information and share information with others through programming
- Example being Wikipedia, APIs, Cryptocurrency, etc.
- Crowdsourcing can help if you have limited resources or if you need multiple ideas / perspectives

Actions:
1. For CSP, we could create a modifyable wiki/GitHub page were students can access TPT and TT information and add onto it if they want to.
2. A crowdsourcing idea we could use is a forum where students can help other students with homework or studying.

### 5.3 - Computing Bias

- Sometimes programs can exclude specific groups or people, purposefully or not
- Types of computing bias: preexisting, technical, emergent:
   - Preexisting: roots in social institutions, attitudes, practices (male vs female, rich vs poor)
   - Technical: technical contrainsts and considerations (better or worse computers, more/less resources to work with)
   - Emergent: Arises in context of use (e.g. Android turns out to have better app options than iOS)

Actions:
1. What caused the program to react this way?
2. I think that this was unintended, as there is almost no chance such a racist feature would be added into a program worked on multiple programs developed for HP, one of the most well known tech companies in the world.
3. If I was the one making or working on this program, I would have sure to test it with multiple faces (age, gender, race, etc.) It's honestly surprising that such a well known company as HP could have slipped up in something as simple (but impactful) as this.

### 5.2 - Digital Divide

- Not all people have access to the internet or computer programs because of where they live or how much money they have
- Can also depend on government (people in China can't access same things as people in US)
- Coders and programers should have digital divide in mind when creating or working on computer software

Actions: 
1. Empowering yourself in the digital world means to give yourself the correct resources and materials to thrive and reach your full potential.
2. People who are empowered can help others by teaching them or helping them get the resources they need.
3. I think that some red tape is increasing the digital divide, because it slows down or stops the rate at which people with less technological opportunites can reach the same level of understanding or knowledge that others can.

### 5.1 - Beneficial and Harmful Effects

- Programs can be beneficial, but can also be used in harmful ways (street cameras can take pictures of people without their permission if they are hacked)
- Computing can have negative health effects (dopamine spikes, addiction, etc.)
- Flowcharts & Unified Modeling Language - different styles of coding, used to model procedures (what they will do). 

Actions:
1. Social Media can be used for communication and entertainment, but can also harm people emotionally
2. Online databases for banks can be very helpful for organizing data, but if they are accessed illegally hackers can access people's money and bank accounts.
3. Satellites can be used by companies like Google Maps to create accurate maps or  take pictures of places, but if they are hacked, they can expose secret military locations/instalations and infringe on people's privacy.

- I understand the concern about dopamine and things like video games, but I think that if you have self control it won't be a problem. I have never missed school or had my grades suffer because of games or social media.
