# Jakub Ponulak - Data Structures 1
These GitHub pages are intended to show my progress throughout this trimester in Data Structures 1.

## About Me:
My name is Jakub Ponulak, and I'm a junior at Del Norte High School. Throughout this school year I have worked on multiple projects within my Computer Science: Principles class, such as "Weather Report", "Backpack Pro", and now "Guython". Weather Report was a website aimed to help students keep track of the weather while also learning about what causes weather phenomena around the world. "Backpack Pro" was a tutoring website which we developed to help students at Del Norte with some of their classes like Math, English, or History. Guython is a continuation of Backpack Pro, focusing on CSP students and the topics they need to learn.
